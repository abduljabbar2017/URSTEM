# URSTEM
This repository contains the **URSTEM** dataset, which was used in our research to design and evaluate the Urdu corpus-based stemmer. The word corpus has been carefully processed, which includes the elimination of Urdu diacritics, as well as the removal of stop words, punctuation, numbers, and symbols. Additionally, English and French characters have been deleted. The resulting corpus comprises 67,126 distinct Urdu words. A total of 19,652 clusters have been created, with each cluster separated by asterisks (*). The first word in every cluster serves as a lemma.\
\
We have dedicated considerable time and effort to its development and refinement. However, as with any dataset created by humans, there may still be some inaccuracies.\
